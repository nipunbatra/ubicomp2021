### Logistics


*   Instructor: Nipun Batra (nipun.batra@iitgn.ac.in)
*   Teaching Assistants:  NA
*   Course Timings: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday (3 PM to 4 PM)  
*   MS Teams code: dr1od52 



### Course Overview

The course will include discussion of the contributions of various fields, including (given the high interdisciplinary nature of the topics, some of the subtopics span multiple topics):
- **human-computer interaction**: novel interfaces for interacting with the computing world, eg. gestural, haptic feedback, augmented reality, wearables, pervasive displays, etc.
- **embedded computing**: wearable computing, edge computing, self-powered systems, intermittent powered systems, energy harvesting, duty cycling, etc.
- **computer vision:** activity sensing based on thermal cameras, multi-spectral imaging, etc.
distributed systems: load scheduling and balancing, edge intelligence, context and content summarization, cloud computing. 
- **machine learning:** applications of recent advances in processing (mostly) structured time-series data towards mostly supervised and unsupervised learning problems, eg. predicting location of a user from the WiFi signal strength (regression problem);  unsupervised activity recognition (clustering); edge machine learning.

The students will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as:

- **activity recognition:** sensing walking gait, activity (walking, sleeping), etc.
- **health sensing:** sensing lung health, breathing, eating, stress, etc.
- **gestural interaction:** novel gestural control and devices like smart rings, smart watches, and interacting with them over varied interfaces, eg. doppler effect based web page browsing, interacting via the jaw muscle movement.
- **speech interaction:** conversational agents, novel earables (ear wearables)
- **fabrication and wearables:** novel fabrication technologies, novel wearables for detecting activities of daily life (mentioned above)
- **localization:** localizing multiple people inside and outside home using novel sensing technologies such as backscatter, multi-path, etc. 



## Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural recognition.
- Practical experience in developing and conducting experiments for ubiquitous systems.
- Practical experience in critically evaluating scientific literature in ubiquitous computing.
