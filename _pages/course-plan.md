## Paper reading

Each lecture will have one or maximum two papers being discussed in details from the [following list of papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NrbBowJmIPeMd1z01uRKFIX0hRc7H-tRQc3j78AiTVE/edit#gid=0). For each paper discussion, we will have three main presenters (like a courtoom scenario):

- A main presenter who summarises the whole paper
- An advocate who advocates for the acceptance of the paper 
- A devil's advocate who fights for the rejection of the paper
